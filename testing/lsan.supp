# In order for pytest to successfully discover tests with libbrtnDeviceServiceShared.so
# compiled with address santizer, the libasan.so must be pre-loaded before invoking
# `pytest --collect-only`. However, preloading libasan.so enables AddressSanitizer for the
# entire process, not just for the specific library compiled with AddressSanitizer.
# This means that all memory allocations and deallocations in the process, including those
# from third-party libraries and Python itself, are tracked by AddressSanitizer. So even
# if tests are found during test discovery, address santizer will report leaks in third
# party libraries and the test process will be considered a failure.
#
# This file instructs address sanitizer to ignore leaks from certain third party libraries so
# test discovery will complete successfully.

leak:libglib-2.0.so
leak:libgirepository-1.0.so
leak:libcrypto.so

# Suppressions for Python 3.x
# ignore leaks starting with `Py` - these cover the corresponding C types - e.g. PyObject_Malloc
leak:^Py
