 * icStateMachine.h
 *
 * General use finite state machine that supports notifications
 * of state changes as-well-as running custom functions to "transition"
 * from one state to another.  This providing a simple, yet robust,
 * level of control for a state machine with pre-determined sequences.
 *
 * State values within the machine are treated as integer
 * to allow for enumeration-based states.
 *
 * Each state optionally contains two optional functions when transitioning
 * from one state to another:
 * 1. transition action - allow caller to drive underlying operations when changing states
 * 2. notification - notify caller of a change in state
 *
 * This implementation does not impose a specified direction
 * of the state transitions (i.e states changes do not have to
 * move to adjacent states), with the exception of the
 * "travel to state" function.
 *
 * NOTE: this does not perform any mutex locking to
 *       allow for single-threaded usage without the
 *       overhead.  If locking is required, it should
 *       be performed by the caller
