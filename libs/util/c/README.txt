Library to provide base runtime support.  Counterpart to the Java
utilLib and commonLib, this houses many of the common objects required
throughout the system (version, base64, timedWait, etc)

The goal is to keep the required of dependencies as low as possible since most
libraries, utilities, and services will depend on this library.
