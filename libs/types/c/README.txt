Library to provide basic data structures.

Most libraries/services/utilities depend on this library, so it
should remain small and constrained to data structure support.

Counterpart to the Java utilLib, but more similar to the
standard JRE java.util package

The goal is to keep the required of dependencies as low as possible since most
libraries, utilities, and services will depend on this library.
