 * repeatingTask.h
 *
 * Creates a repeating task that will loop until told to cancel.
 * Each iteration of the loop can pause for a specified amount of
 * time before executing again.  Helpful for things such as "monitor threads"
 * that need to execute the same operation over and over again, with an
 * optional delay between executions.
 *
 * NOTE: uses the concept of 'handles' vs 'objects' due to
 * the nature of tasks executing and releasing in the background.
 * this prevents memory issues with the caller having a pointer
 * to an object that may have been released in the background.
